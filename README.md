# Project 2 Daniel Wilson
#### I tried to use a simple theme for this project that I could manipulate using CSS.
## Known Problems
#### This was a very challenging project, and I was not able to finish all the assigned milestones.
#### For some reason I cannot completely control when messages are sent to the server from the client.
#### After a user logs in, a refresh is neccessary before old messages are retrieved. 
#### Then a following refresh is needed before current messages will display.
#### I ran out of time to get google login implimented, and the chat bot.
#### I would complete the above milestones and work on UI a little more.
